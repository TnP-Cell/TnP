          IIIT Bhagalpur is on a fascinating Journey of growth and development.
          In terms of its impact as a technical institution in the country, the
          institute has already made some significant strides. The instituteâ€™s
          own campus on 50 acres on the bank of river Ganga is fast getting
          ready to be operational within a short span of time. The institute has
          increased its student strength from a meager 70 in 2017 to over 280
          today which is likely to increase by 800 in 2022. The quality of
          teaching and research at IIIT Bhagalpur comes from the careful choice
          of faculty members. As part of the new curriculum, we are offering
          students more choices and imbibing a sense of social responsibility
          and national commitment in them based on a hands-on approach with
          strong fundamentals. By collaborating actively with the world's best
          academic institution and industry, IIIT Bhagalpur has expanded its
          outreach. Collaborating on research is not just a plus in our
          portfolio, but integral to our growth.<br /><br />
          In the new millennium, IIIT Bhagalpur adopted a new mission and vision
          that aims to become a leading institute. IIIT Bhagalpur has made a
          remarkable start. However, there is a long way to go, and I am
          confident that with the active collaboration of all stakeholders,
          including students, faculty, staff, collaborators, parents of
          students, governmental organizations, and the general public, we can
          fulfill our mission.
